# Guidelines for using WhatsApp Blaster

You might wonder: _“Can my WhatsApp account get banned if I use WhatsApp Blaster?”_ While there’s always a chance, following these tips can greatly reduce the risk. Think of these guidelines as your roadmap for using the tool effectively and safely.

#### **✅ DOs**

1. **Use a Trusted Number**\
   Always use a phone number that’s been active on WhatsApp for a while. New numbers are more likely to get flagged, so it’s better to stick to one that’s already trusted.
2. **Start Small and Take It Slow**\
   If you’re using WhatsApp Blaster for the first time, send messages in small batches of 20-40. Gradually increase your daily messages, but don’t exceed 200 messages a day.
3. **Warm Up Your Number**\
   If your number is new to bulk messaging, start slow:
   * Day 1: Send no more than 50 messages.
   * Gradually add 40-50 more each day until you reach 200 messages per day.
4. **Use Random Delays for Large Campaigns**\
   WhatsApp Blaster includes random delays to make your activity look natural. The default delays are short, which is fine for smaller campaigns. However, if you’re sending more than 40-50 messages a day, increase the delays to about **20-30 seconds** to keep things safer.
5. **Complete Your Profile**\
   A detailed profile with your name, picture, and a short description builds trust with recipients. It also helps your account appear more legitimate to WhatsApp.
6. **Encourage Real Conversations**\
   WhatsApp works best when it’s used for meaningful two-way communication. In the **PRO version**, you can use placeholders to personalize messages—like adding someone’s name—which makes it easier to connect and encourages replies.

#### **❌ DON’Ts**

1. **Avoid Using Brand-New Numbers**\
   New WhatsApp numbers are more likely to get flagged. Instead, use a number that’s been active for some time.
2. **Be Careful with Unsaved Contacts**\
   Sending messages to unsaved numbers is a feature in the PRO version, but use it thoughtfully. Stick to people likely to recognize your number or message to avoid being flagged.
3. **Don’t Send Generic or Irrelevant Messages**\
   If too many people report your messages as spam, WhatsApp might block your account. Avoid generic messages. Instead, focus on personalized and valuable content that people actually want to receive.

#### **ℹ️ Disclaimer**

While these tips can reduce the risk, no tool can guarantee that your WhatsApp account won’t be flagged. Using WhatsApp Blaster responsibly is key. If your account is ever blocked, you’ll need to contact WhatsApp directly.

By following these guidelines, you can safely send messages, connect with your audience, and get the most out of WhatsApp Blaster.
