# Can I try the PRO version before purchasing?

I don't offer a demo or trial of the PRO version. However, you can purchase it with a 14-day, no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee, giving you the opportunity to explore all its features risk-free. Alternatively, you can start with the Free version, which, while limited in features, still provides a good sense of how the tool functions.
