# Is there a maximum number of messages I can send per day?

There’s no official limit set by WhatsApp, but sending too many messages too quickly can flag your account as spam and lead to restrictions. To stay safe and avoid account issues, here are some practical tips:

1. **Daily Limit**: A good rule of thumb is to stick to **around 200 messages per day**. You can send more, but staying under this number is safer to avoid being flagged.
2.  **Sending Rate**: Send **5-10 messages per minute**. By default, WhatsApp Blaster uses these delay settings:

    * **Default delay**: 4 seconds (4,000 ms).
    * **Random delay**: 1-2 seconds (1,000-2,000 ms).\
      To be even safer, you can increase the delays, for example, to **20-30 seconds**. This slows things down further and reduces the risk of triggering spam detection.

    Here’s what the delay settings look like in WhatsApp Blaster:

3. **Warm Up Your Number**: If your number is new to bulk messaging, don’t send too many messages right away. Start slow:
   * **Day 1**: Send up to 50 messages.
   * Gradually increase by 40-50 messages per day until you reach around 200 messages per day.\
     Warming up your number helps it appear more trustworthy.
4. **Split Large Campaigns**: If you need to send more than 200 messages, spread them over multiple days:
   * Day 1: Send the first batch (e.g., 200 messages).
   * Day 2: Send the next batch, and so on.

**Important**: These are just guidelines—not hard rules. It’s better to start slow and stay cautious to avoid triggering WhatsApp’s spam detection.
