# Is there a maximum number of messages I can send per day?

While there isn't a fixed limit on the number of messages you can send per day, itâ€™s advisable to limit your sending rate to around **200 messages per day** and **5-10 messages per minute**. This precaution helps avoid potential issues like account suspension.

WhatsApp Blaster also provides the option to set custom and random delays between messages, helping you stay within safe usage limits and reduce the risk of triggering WhatsApp's anti-spam measures.
