# Is there a risk of getting banned on WhatsApp when using WhatsApp Blaster?

Yes, there is a risk of getting banned on WhatsApp when using tools like WhatsApp Blaster, especially if you send a large volume of messages to unsaved contacts. WhatsApp’s official guidelines strictly prohibit the use of unauthorized automated or bulk messaging. You can review these guidelines [here.](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/unauthorized-use-of-automated-or-bulk-messaging-on-whatsapp/?lang=en)

That said, many users have found ways to lower this risk by following certain best practices. While not officially endorsed by WhatsApp, these methods have worked for others.

I’ve put together **Guidelines for using WhatsApp Blaster** to help you minimize the risk. You can find them here: [**Guidelines for using WhatsApp Blaster**](../fundamentals/guidelines-for-using-whatsapp-blaster.md).
