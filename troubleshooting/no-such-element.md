# Resolving Error: 7 No Such Element Error When Sending Images or Documents

This error is most likely due to your Chrome browser not being set to English. The WhatsApp Blaster relies on English menu names (e.g., "Photos & videos") to function correctly. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

**Step 1: Ensure You Are Using the Latest WhatsApp Blaster PRO Version**

Before making any changes, ensure you are using the latest version of WhatsApp Blaster PRO. Updates often fix compatibility issues and bugs.

* Download the latest PRO version here: [WhatsApp Blaster PRO Download](https://pythonandvba.com/whatsapp-pro-download).

**Step 2: Use the Chrome Test Browser**

Instead of changing your default Chrome browser language to English, it is **strongly recommended** to use the **Chrome Test Browser**. This ensures compatibility without affecting your main browser setup.

1. Open the WhatsApp Blaster.
2. Navigate to the "General" section (refer to the screenshot below):\

   * **Set "Use Default Chrome Installation" to NO.**
   * Enter the path to your Chrome Test Browser in the "Custom Chrome Path" field.

1. Navigate to the directory where WhatsApp Blaster is saved.
2. Look for a folder named `ChromeUserData`.
3. Delete the folder.
4. Run the WhatsAppBlaster again.
