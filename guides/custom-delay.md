# How to set up a custom delay

In the **Settings** section of the template, you can:

* **Set a Default Delay**: This is the base time in seconds between all messages. It’s recommended to set this to no less than **4 seconds** to ensure that the WhatsApp Blaster runs smoothly.
* **Add a Random Delay**: You can further extend the delay by enabling the **Random Delay Time Between Messages** option. This adds variability to the delay, which can be customized with **minimum** and **maximum** delay values in seconds.

This setup helps mimic natural messaging patterns, reducing the risk of triggering WhatsApp’s anti-spam measures.
