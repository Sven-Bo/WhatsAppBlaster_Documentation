# 3 messaging tips to get the most out of WhatsApp Blaster

If you want to get better results with WhatsApp Blaster, it’s all about using a few smart strategies. These tips can help make your messages more engaging, professional, and effective.&#x20;

### 1. Personalize Your Messages with Placeholders

No one likes receiving a generic message. Using placeholders is one of the easiest ways to make your messages feel more personal. You can automatically add details like names, order numbers, or anything else specific to the recipient.

**Why this works:**

* It makes your messages feel less robotic and more human.
* It helps build trust and engagement by showing you care about the recipient.

**Example Input:**\
`Hi {{name}}, your order ({{order_id}}) has been shipped!`

**Example Output:**\
`Hi John, your order (12345) has been shipped!`

### 2. Use Formatting to Make Messages Pop

Your messages shouldn’t just be text—they should _stand out_. WhatsApp Blaster lets you use bold, italic, and even strikethrough text to make your messages more visually appealing.

**How to format:**

* **Bold**: Use `*` (e.g., `*bold text*` → **bold text**)
* _Italic_: Use `_` (e.g., `_italic text_` → _italic text_)
* ~~Strikethrough~~: Use `~` (e.g., `~strikethrough text~` → ~~strikethrough text~~)
* **Line breaks**: Use the pipe `|` (e.g., `Line 1 | Line 2` → Line 1 on one line, Line 2 on the next)

**Pro Tip:** Adding emojis can bring your messages to life and make them more engaging!

**Example Input:**\
`✨ _Your order is confirmed!_ | 📦 *Tracking Number:* 12345 | Thank you for choosing us!`

### 3. Add Media Files with Captions

Sometimes, words aren’t enough. Attaching images, videos, or documents can make your messages more engaging and professional. Adding a caption is the icing on the cake—it provides context and supports formatting options like bold, italic, and strikethrough.

Here’s how you can do it:

1. Set the **Type** to `Media`.
2. Input the file path in the `Text` field (e.g., `C:\path\promo.jpg`).
3. Add your caption in the `Caption` field.

**Example Input:**\
`✨ *Supercharge Your Messaging with WhatsApp Blaster!* ✨ |🚀 *Features that make life easier:* |*Send bulk messages* – personalized and efficient! |*Reach unsaved numbers* – no need to add contacts. |*Automated Number Cleaner* – perfect format every time. |*Send media & documents* – available in PRO! |*Customizable delays* – keep your account safe. |🎯 *Perfect for:* Small business owners 📈 |Marketers 💼 |Anyone who values their time ⏳ |💡 *Try it today and see the magic happen!*`
