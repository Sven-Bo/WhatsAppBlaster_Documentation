# How to send a multiline message

Yes, you can send multiline text messages by using the **pipe symbol** `|` to indicate line breaks.

#### Example:

To create a line break, use the pipe character:

<pre><code>This is the first paragraph.<a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">|</a>This is the second paragraph.
</code></pre>

Hereâ€™s how it looks:

```
This is the first paragraph.
This is the second paragraph.
```

Refer to the image below for a visual example.
