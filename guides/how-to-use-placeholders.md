# How to use placeholders

Placeholders allow you to customize and personalize your WhatsApp messages effortlessly. Here's how they work:

* **Global Placeholders:** Use these for information that remains the same across all messages, such as your business name. For example, you can use `{{business_name}}` to automatically insert 'Sunshine Bakery' into each message.
* **Number-Specific Placeholders:** These are used to personalize messages with details unique to each recipient. For instance, `{{customer_name}}` can be used to address each customer by their first name, making your messages more engaging.
* **Date Placeholders:** When using placeholders for dates, ensure you format them correctly as outlined in the 'Placeholder Date Format' section to display dates accurately in your messages.
