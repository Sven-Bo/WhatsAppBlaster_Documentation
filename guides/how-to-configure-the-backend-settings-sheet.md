# How to configure the backend settings sheet

When the WhatsApp Blaster bot automates tasks, it uses something called **XPaths** to find and interact with elements like buttons and text fields in WhatsApp Web. Sometimes WhatsApp updates their page structure, which means these XPaths need to be updated too. Don't worryâ€”I handle most of this automatically in the background for you.

#### Retrieve Latest XPaths

This setting tells the bot whether it should grab the latest XPaths from my server:

* **True** (Recommended): Keeps everything running smoothly by automatically updating to the latest XPaths when you start the bot.
* **False**: Stops the bot from getting updates from my server. This is mainly for debugging or testing purposes, and in general, you won't need to change it.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** It's best to keep this set to **True** so that the bot stays updated and works reliably.
{% endhint %}



**XPaths Version**

The **XPaths Version** setting lets you choose between two different sets of XPaths: **Version A** or **Version B**.

* **Version A** and **Version B** are generally the same.
* In rare cases, WhatsApp might gradually roll out changes to some users. Having two versions helps ensure that the bot can adapt to these changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** You can leave this set to **Version A** by default. No need to worry about this unless instructed otherwise.
{% endhint %}
