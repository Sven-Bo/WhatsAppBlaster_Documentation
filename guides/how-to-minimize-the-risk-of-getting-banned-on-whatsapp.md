# How to minimize the risk of getting banned on WhatsApp

To minimize the risk of getting banned while using WhatsApp Blaster, consider implementing the following strategies:

**1. Warm Up Your Number**

* Start with sending no more than 50 messages on the first day with a new account.
* Gradually increase the number of messages each day by 40-50, but do not exceed 200 messages per day.
* This gradual increase helps WhatsApp recognize that you are a genuine user and not a bot.

**2. Control the Sending Rate**

* Limit the rate at which you send messages to no more than 2-3 per minute.
* Introduce random delays of 20-30 seconds between consecutive messages to mimic natural user behavior.

**3. Avoid Messaging Unsaved Contacts**

* Minimize sending messages to contacts that are not saved in your address book, as this is often flagged as spam by WhatsApp.

**4. Optimize Your WhatsApp (Business) Profile**

* Ensure your profile is complete with a proper (business) name, profile picture, and a detailed description. A well-established profile appears more legitimate to WhatsApp and your recipients.

While these tips can help reduce the risk of being banned, it’s important to remember that using WhatsApp Blaster carries inherent risks, and there’s no guarantee that your account won’t be blocked by WhatsApp. Proceed with caution and follow these best practices to minimize potential issues.
