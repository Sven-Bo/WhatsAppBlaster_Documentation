# How to send a message to a group chat

If you want to send a message to a WhatsApp group instead of an individual number, simply enter the **group name** in the **Number** column of the template.

Just type the **exact name of the WhatsApp group** as it appears in WhatsApp, and the message will be sent to all members of the specified group.
