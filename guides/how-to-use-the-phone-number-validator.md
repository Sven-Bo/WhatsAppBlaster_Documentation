## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The Phone Number Validation & Formatting tool helps you prepare your contact lists for SMS messaging by ensuring all phone numbers are properly formatted and valid. This tool is essential for maximizing your SMS delivery rates and avoiding wasted messages.

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

* **E.164 Formatting**: Converts phone numbers to the international E.164 format
* **Validation**: Checks if numbers are valid and can receive SMS messages
* **Country Detection**: Determines the country of origin for each number
* **Type Classification**: Identifies whether numbers are mobile, landline, or VoIP
* **Timezone Information**: Shows the timezone associated with each number

### Default Region Setting <a href="#default-region-setting" id="default-region-setting"></a>

The default region setting tells the system which country to use when processing phone numbers without a country code.

**How it works:**

* Numbers with a country code (like +1 or +44) are always processed correctly regardless of your default region
* Numbers without a country code use your selected default region to determine the country

**Examples:**

* If you enter "+1 555-123-4567" → Always formatted as "+15551234567" (US) regardless of default region
* If you enter "555-123-4567" with US as default region → Formatted as "+15551234567"
* If you enter "555-123-4567" with UK as default region → Formatted as "+44555123456"

### Frequently Asked Questions <a href="#frequently-asked-questions" id="frequently-asked-questions"></a>

<details>

<summary>How accurate is the phone number validation?</summary>

The phone number validation uses Google's phone number database to verify if numbers are properly formatted and potentially valid. The tool checks:

* Country code validity
* Number length for the specific country
* Number pattern matching for the region
* Basic structural validity

However, it cannot guarantee with 100% certainty that a number is currently in service or able to receive WhatsApp messages. Only sending a test message can confirm actual deliverability.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I validate international numbers?</summary>

Yes! The tool supports phone numbers from virtually all countries worldwide. For best results with international numbers:

* Include the country code with a plus sign (e.g., +44 for UK)
* If the country code is missing, the system will use your selected default region setting

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does the tool handle different number formats?</summary>

The tool is designed to be flexible and can handle most common phone number formats:

* Numbers with spaces, dashes, or parentheses
* Numbers with or without country codes
* Numbers with leading zeros or trunk prefixes

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there a limit to how many numbers I can validate at once?</summary>

The tool is designed to handle hundreds of phone numbers in a single batch. For very large lists (1000+ numbers), the process may take a bit longer to complete.
